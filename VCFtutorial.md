## What's New in My Genome? 

Explain VCF files here (variant call format) 

### Exercise 1 

The first few lines of a VCF file are called the 'header'. The header contains useful information about what the data in the file looks like and how it was generated. All of the lines in the header start with the character '#'. 

Use two different command line methods to view the information in the header for the file 'myVCF.vcf'. 

First, make sure you can see the file using the command 
```console
foo@bar:~$ ls -l 
myVCF.vcf 
```

1. Our first strategy might be to look at the first few lines of the file. We know the 'head' command will give us the first 10 by default. Let's take a look. 

```console
foo@bar:~$ head myVCF.vcf
```

2. Our second strategy might be to pull out the lines beginning with '#'. We know that 'grep' will help us pull out specific data. Let's try that.
